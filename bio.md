# Programming Background
Experience I have in programming include:  MatLab (approximately 4 years), AutoLisp, HTML, CSS, Javascript, but it wasn't until last quarter when I really got into C++ in CS165.

In fact my *favorite* CS165 project that I worked on last quarter was the final project because I created a short RPG game that consisted of 3 puzzles and several battles with creatures. Also the game had 3 different options: easy, medium, hard.  The TA's for that class enjoyed playing my game so I was fortunate to have that experience doing the final project on a RPG game.
